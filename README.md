# LogixUtils

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that tweaks some logix things

All features are toggleable in the config, most are on by default

### Current features: 
 - Scales relays relative to user
 - Allows aligning logix to snapped angles with the UI_TargetingController
 - Allows spawning Logix node at the same rotation as the user when in VR
 - Adds extra input nodes, and tweaks the behavior of some existing ones

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [LogixUtils.dll](https://github.com/badhaloninja/LogixUtils/releases/latest/download/LogixUtils.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder.
